# @strata-game-library/shaders

Standalone GLSL shaders for Three.js -- terrain, water, sky, volumetrics, clouds, fur, and more.

This package provides raw GLSL shader strings that work with any Three.js project, independent of React or React Three Fiber.

See the [Shaders documentation](/shaders/) for usage guides and the API reference below for individual shader exports.
